Hacktoberfest is a yearly one month long virtual festival event to celebrate open source contributions presented by Digital Ocean, Intel and DEV. It encourages people to contribute to open source in October celebrating a sense of community, learning and giving back.
It is the easiest way to get into open source! During this event, anyone can support open code by contributing changes and earn limited-edition swag.
